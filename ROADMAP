There is always more to be done in a security package :-)

Most of the exciting stuff will happen once we've build a VMod that gives
us access to the request body. We need this to 
 - iterate over header names and values
 - iterate over POST parameters
 - do other body validation

modules/cloak.vcl could be even cleverer
modules/request.vcl:
  awaiting vmod to iterate over headers...
  http 0.9 should send no headers!

todo maybe: 
  http 1.0 cannot have host, vary, warning, proxy-auth, content-md5, alternates,
Via,Upgrade, Etag, If-none-match, If-unmodified-since, if-match, cache-control, age,
  Range => content-range, expect, accept-encoding, TE, Transfer-encoding: chunked
(but we should prolly accept these anyway, or maybe wash them?)

Connection header incorrectly forwarded by 1.0 proxy.
